Ideas for future improvement:

Window Object:

- GLFW Window
- window surface

Device Object:

- Physical Device
- Logical Device

App Object:

- Instance
- Validation layers

How this works:

1. Creates an instance of vulkan

- define a struct with the application info
- get the required GLFW extensions

2. If in debug mode, enables the validation layers
3.
